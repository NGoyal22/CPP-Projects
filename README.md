C++ Programming Language

Overview
C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that builds upon the foundation of the C language with additional features for object-oriented programming. It is widely used for developing high-performance software, system applications, game development, and more.

Key Features
Object-Oriented: C++ supports the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing developers to organize code into classes and objects for better structure and modularity.

High Performance: Known for its efficiency, C++ allows low-level manipulation of data and provides features like pointers, making it suitable for resource-intensive applications.

Standard Template Library (STL): C++ includes a rich set of standard libraries, known as the Standard Template Library (STL), offering reusable data structures and algorithms.

Cross-Platform: C++ code can be compiled and executed on various platforms, making it a popular choice for developing cross-platform applications.

Memory Management: Developers have control over memory allocation and deallocation, enabling efficient use of system resources.

Getting Started
To compile and run C++ programs, you will need a C++ compiler such as GCC or Microsoft Visual C++. Popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or JetBrains CLion provide excellent support for C++ development.

Example Code:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
